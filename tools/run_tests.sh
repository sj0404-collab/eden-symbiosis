#
#  1. Do NOT put <eden>/src/common on the include path. Eden ships its own
#     common/assert.h, which shadows the standard <cassert>; every assert()
#     then expands to nothing and the tests pass without checking anything.
#     Only -I<eden>/src is correct.
#
#  2. Eden's logging is a real dependency of the layer. Rather than linking
#     half the emulator, a tiny stub supplies FmtLogMessageImpl.

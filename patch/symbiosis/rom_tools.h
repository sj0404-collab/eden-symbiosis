/**
 * @file rom_tools.h
 * @brief Dump inspection and conversion helpers.
 *
 * Two problems this addresses, both of which cost people hours:
 *
 *  1. **XCI wastes space.** A cartridge dump is padded to the physical card
 *     size, so a 3.2 GB game can occupy 4 GB or 8 GB on disk. The useful data
 *     ends at `valid_data_end` in the gamecard header; everything past it is
 *     filler. Converting to NSP, or simply trimming, reclaims that space with
 *     no loss.
 *
 *  2. **Broken dumps look like emulator bugs.** A truncated download, a dump
 *     that stopped early, or a file missing the keys it needs will fail at
 *     load time with an error that points at the emulator rather than the
 *     file. Checking the header first turns "it crashed" into "this file is
 *     1.2 GB short".
 *
 * Everything here operates on files the user already has. Nothing is
 * downloaded, and no encryption is bypassed: the tools read headers and copy
 * bytes, exactly as the emulator itself does when loading.
